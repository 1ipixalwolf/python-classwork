# Welcome

## Introduction to Programming - Python

This course focuses on a general introduction to computer programming. This course emphasizes designing and implementing structured and logically correct programs with good documentation. It is centered on basic programming concepts, including control structures, modularization, and data processing. Python is used to implement program designs. It emphasizes the writing of multiple programs following the software development process, from start to finish, including design, implementation, and testing.

## Naming Convention and Commenting the Code

The assignments and practice code files that you will be passing in will need to have comments added to them.

### File Names

When naming the files to be passed in, please make sure it has the course number, the assignment/practice number, and your name. Here are a couple of examples:

> csc1019-practice-02-patrick-mcdougle.py \
> 1019-assignment-03-pmcdougle.py \
> 1019_p04_pmcdougl.py

> \<course#>\_\<assignment#>\_\<your name>.py

Pick a naming convention that you like but contains the 3 items asked for.

### File Comments

At the top of your file should include your name, the date, and a description of the problem you are trying to solve. Also having the assignment's name would be helpful (i.e. Assignment 1 or Practice 02). In python, everything after the # mark is considered a comment.

#### **Example:**

```python
# Patrick McDougle
# CSC 1019 Intro to Programming
# August 11, 2022
# Assignment 01
# This program calculates the meaning of the universe.
```

### Function Comments

When we get to functions, you will need to have a function header comment block that should include the function name, the function inputs, and the function output. This will make more sense when we get to functions.

#### **Example:**

```python
# Function : Foo
# Description : This function does Foo and not Bar
# Parameters :
# Return :
```

## Style Guide

When working on your programs, it is a good idea to follow a style guide so that everyone can read your programming without having to deal with funkiness.  We will use the Google Python Style Guide for this course.  It's long and boring and might not make sense to you.  So here is a list of sections to concentrate on.

-   2.5 Global Variables
-   2.8 Default Iterators and Operators
-   3.1-3.6
-   3.8.1-3.83
-   3.8.5
-   3.10
-   3.12
-   3.16

## Grading Rubric for Programming Assignments

Here is the list of things I will be checking for each of your assignments.

-   Input/Output
    -   Does the assignment handle the input and output of data as specified in the assignment?
-   Documentation
    -   Does the assignment have the following comments?
        -   File Comment Block
            -   Name
            -   Date
            -   Class
            -   Description of what the program/file does.
        -   Function Comment Block
            -   Description of the inputs
            -   Description of the output.
            -   Description of the function.
        -   Other comment blocks to help understand what the code is doing.
-   Does the code use good programming techniques?
    -   Code standards are followed.
    -   The program shows an understanding of the weeks/modules concepts.
-   Does the program execute properly?
    -   The program produces the correct output based on the input given.
    -   The program does not crash or throw an error.
