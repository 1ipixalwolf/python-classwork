# Practice 01

Create your first Python program that simply prints out "Hello World!" to the command prompt.

What should be in the program file that is submitted:

-   Header Comments (see Welcome area)
-   Any other comments as needed
-   Python code that prints "Hello World!"

What should be passed in:

-   A file following the "Naming Convention and Commenting the Code" in the welcome section of this course.  This file will be your program file with the Python code in it.
-   A screenshot showing the console window where you ran the python code.  Make sure you are NOT in the Python interpreter when running this code.
-   A screenshot of your editor showing the program in it.
