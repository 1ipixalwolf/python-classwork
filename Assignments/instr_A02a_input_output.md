# Assignment 02a

Get some practice inputting numbers and doing calculations. Type in two numbers, and show the results of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing the numbers. (What happens to the program if the user tries to divide by zero?)

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Input

Two integer numbers, a and b.

## Output

-   a + b = result
-   a â€“ b = result
-   a \* b = result
-   a / b = result

## Sample execution

```output
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
10 + 2 = 12
10 - 2 = 8
10 * 2 = 20
10 / 2 = 5.0
```
