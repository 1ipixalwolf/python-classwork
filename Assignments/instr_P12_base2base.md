# Practice 12

Write a program that will ask the user for the number to convert, the base the number is in, and the base the number should go to.Â  Then the program should present the number in the new base.

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Input

Ask the user for the following three things:

-   The number to convert
-   The current base number. (2, 8, 10, 16)
-   The number should be converted into what base. (2, 8, 10, 16)

## Output

Display the converted number value along with what base it is in.

## Note

Use the built in number conversion functions that were talked about in the reading.

-   `int()`
-   `bin()`
-   `oct()`
-   `hex()`
