# Practice 10

Write a program to read through a file and print the contents of the file (line by line) all in upper case. **HINT:** You should remove whitespace at the end of each line.

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Outputs

Executing the program will look similar to (but should include all lines):

```output
Enter a file name: mbox-short.txt
