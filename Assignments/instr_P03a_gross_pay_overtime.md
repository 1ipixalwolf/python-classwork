# Practice 03a

Rewrite the gross pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40.

> Enter Hours: 45 \
> Enter Rate: 12.56 \
> Pay: 475.0

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Input

The program should accept 2 inputs:

-   the hours worked (integer)
-   the hourly rate (float)

## Output

The program should have an output similar to \
"\<hours> hours x \$ \<rate> per hour = \$\<amount>"

### **Example:**

-   45 hours x $12.56 per hour = $596.60

## Sample execution

```output
Enter the hours worked: 45
Enter the pay rate per hour: 12.56
45 hours x $12.56 per hour = $596.60
```
