# Practice 06

Write a function named `biggest_number()` that will accept three numbers and return the largest one. Your program should _not_ expect any user input, and it does not need to print anything on the screen. The function should _not_ print anything.

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Inputs

None. The program itself will not ask the user for any values This is very important - do not include any `input()` statements in the program!

The function will take in 3 integer values.

## Outputs

The function will return the largest number. \
The function will not print anything out.

## Tests

To test the code, you can print the returning value to the screen like so:

Python code:

```python
print(biggest_number(10, 20, 30))
print(biggest_number(100, 20, 30))
print(biggest_number(10, 200, 30))
```

Output:

```output
30
100
200
```
