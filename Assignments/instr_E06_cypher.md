# Assignment Extra Credit 06

Create a function named `cypher()` that will accept a string and an integer as a parameter. Using the `ord()` and `chr()` functions we discussed in class, the function should calculate the unicode value for each letter in the string and return a new string with each letter in the string offset by the integer provided.

## Input

There is no user input in this program. The code should only have function.

## Output

There is no output required for this program. The program may print the result that are returned from the function to test it out.

## Sample Execution

Here is some code that can be used to test the program.

```python
code_phrase = cypher('Hello', 1)
print(code_phrase)
code_phrase = cypher('HAL', 1)
print(code_phrase)
```

The below would be the result.

```output
Ifmmp
IBM
```
