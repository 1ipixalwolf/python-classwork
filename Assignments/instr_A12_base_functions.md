# Assignment 12

Let's assume that python does not have the built-in ability to convert a number from one base to another.  Create the functions to convert from one base to another.  Create the following functions:

-   `dec_to_bin()`
-   `dec_to_oct()`
-   `dec_to_hex()`
-   `bin_to_dec()`
-   `oct_to_dec()`
-   `hex_to_dec()`

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Input

No inputs from the user, but you will need to test your functions.

The functions will take in one string number value.

## Output

The functions will each return a string value.

## Note

The functions in the program should behave almost like the built-in functions.
