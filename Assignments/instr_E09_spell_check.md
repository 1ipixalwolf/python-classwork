# Assignment Extra 11

Write a program that will allow the user to type in a word. It should tell them whether it is in the dictionary file provided (make the check case-insensitive). If the word is NOT in the file, it should ask the user if they want to add it and append it to the end of the file if they say yes.

## Input

You will need to prompt the user for the information you need.  Put some effort into what this should be.

## output

Again, you will need to provide output that tells the user the information they need about the word the entered.

## Note

To do this problem, you will need to know how to open a file.  This is covered in next weeks content.
