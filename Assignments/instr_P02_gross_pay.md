# Practice 02

Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 12.56 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 439.60). You should use input to read a `string` and then use `int()` or `float()` to convert the string to the appropriate number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data at this time.

We wonâ€™t worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python `round()` function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places. Or play with the string format ability that python has.

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Input

The program should accept 2 inputs:

-   the hours worked (integer)
-   the hourly rate (float)

## Output

35 hours x $12.56 per hour = $439.60

## Sample execution

```output
Enter the hours worked: 35
Enter the pay rate per hour: 12.56
35 hours x $12.56 per hour = $439.60
```
