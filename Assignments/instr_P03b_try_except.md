# Practice 03b

Rewrite the gross pay with overtime program using try and except so that the program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program.

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Input

The program should accept 2 inputs:

-   the hours worked (integer)
-   the hourly rate (float)

## Output

The program should have an output similar to \
"\<hours> hours x \$ \<rate> per hour = \$\<amount>"

### **Example:**

-   45 hours x $12.56 per hour = $596.60

## Sample execution #1

```output
Enter the hours worked: 20
Enter the pay rate per hour: nine
Error, please enter numeric input
```

## Sample execution #2

```output
Enter the hours worked: forty
Error, please enter numeric input
```
