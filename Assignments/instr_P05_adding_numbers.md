# Practice 05

Write a function named `add_two()` that will accept two numbers as parameters and print the result of adding them in x + y = z format.

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Inputs

None. The program itself will not ask the user for any values This is very important - do not include any `input()` statements in the program!

```python
# NOT ALLOWED FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT
a = input("Enter a number: ")
```

Instead, I will add something like the following to the code to test it:

```python
add_two(1, 1)
add_two(2, 3)
add_two(20, 30)
add_two(10, 10)
add_two(12, 13)
```

So, the function will take in two integer values.

## Outputs

The whole number sentence that shows the result of adding the numbers.

## Sample Output 1

```output
Calling the function as add_two(1,1)
1 + 1 = 2
```

## Sample Output 2

```output
Calling the function as add_two(2,3)
2 + 3 = 5
```
