# Practice 04

Booster seats that children use to make a car safer typically have both a height and weight requirement. For instance, the Mifold booster seat requires a height between 40 and 57 inches and a weight between 40 and 100 pounds. Write a program that allows the user to input the height and weight of a child and outputs whether this booster seat is safe for the child to use. If it isn't, it should indicate whether the child doesn't meet the height requirement, the weight requirement, or both height and weight.

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Safety test

If child's height between 40 and 57 inches and child's weight between 40 and 100 pounds This booster seat is safe for the child to use

### Height failure test

-   Height=39, weight=50
-   Height=58, weight=50

The child doesn't meet the height requirement.

### Weight failure test

-   Height=50, weight=39
-   Height=50, weight=101

The child doesn't meet the weight requirement.

### Height & Weight failure test

Child fails height test and child fails weight test, the child doesn't meet both height and weight requirements.
