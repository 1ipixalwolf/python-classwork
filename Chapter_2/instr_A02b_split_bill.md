# Assignment 02

Write a program that will help a group of people splitting a bill at a restaurant decide how much each person should pay. The program should allow the user to enter the bill, the amount the user wish to tip, and the number of people and print a message indicating how much each person should contribute.

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the comment should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Input

The user should input the following:

-   the bill
-   the tip amount (as a percentage, not a decimal value)
-   the number of people splitting the bill

Be sure to use appropriate data types for each input.

## Output

The phrase, "Each person should pay $" followed by the bill. Do not round the final result.

## Hint

To calculate the amount for the tip, multiply the bill times the tip percent divided by 100.

## Sample execution

```output
Bill: 62.41
Tip percent: 20
Number of people: 4
Each person should pay $18.723
```
