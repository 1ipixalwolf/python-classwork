# Assignment 11

For this assignment, the program will have a function that translates words from English into the made-up language Pig Latin. Write a function called `pig_latin()` that will accept a word and return a modified version according to the following rules:

-   If the word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), simply add "way" to the end of the word

    > Example: "ant" becomes "antway"

-   If the word begins with a single consonant, move the consonant to the end and add "ay" to the end of the word.

    > Example: "cat" becomes "atcay"

-   If the word begins with more than one consonant, move the first two consonants to the end and add "ay" to the end of the word.

    > Example: "shark" becomes "arkshay"

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Input

The program should NOT include any input statements.
