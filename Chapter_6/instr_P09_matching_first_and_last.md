# Practice 09

Write a function named `first_last_match()` that will accept a string as a parameter and returns a boolean value.

If the string is empty (has a length of zero) the function should return false.

A string of length one should return true.

Otherwise, the function should return true if the first and last letter of the string are the same and false otherwise.

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Test

Here is a test dataset to test your code with.

```python
first_last_match("ahhhhhhhhhhha")   # true
first_last_match("")                # false
first_last_match("h")               # true
first_last_match("heyoooo")         # false
```
