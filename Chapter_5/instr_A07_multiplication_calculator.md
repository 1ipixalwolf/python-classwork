# Assignment 07

Write a program that will accept two numbers as input and show the result of multiplying those two numbers. It should continue until the user enters 0 for **both** terms. In addition to passing all tests, the program _must_ include comments and use good variable names to receive full credit.

Be sure to include comments in the code. At a minimum, the file should include your name, date, course info and the purpose/description of the program at the top of the program file.

## Input

Your program should accept two integers as input.

## Output

Your program should output a brief greeting message, the result of the multiplication problem, and a final Goodbye! message once the program is complete. See below for sample output.

## Sample Execution

```output
This program will solve multiplication problems.
Enter 0 for both terms to quit.

First number: 3
Second number: 8
3 x 8 = 24

First number: 3
Second number: 4
3 x 4 = 12

First number: 4
Second number: 5
4 x 5 = 20

First number: 10
Second number: 0
10 x 0 = 0

First number: 0
Second number: 0
Goodbye!
```
